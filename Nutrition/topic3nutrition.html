	<h1>Does Coffee Help or Cause Inflammation?</h1>
	<hr>

	<p class = "paragragh">
		Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide.<br>
		It’s rich in an array of beneficial compounds that may help maintain optimal health and protect you from certain diseases.<br>
		Coffee is also thought to help reduce inflammation, at least in some people.<br>
		This article reviews coffee’s effects on inflammation, as well as whether decaffeinated coffee has the same effects.<br><br>

		Contains a complex mixture of active compounds<br>
		Regular coffee contains a complex mixture of active compounds, including caffeine, chlorogenic acid (CGA), cafestol, trigonelline, and kahweol. Decaffeinated coffee contains the same compounds, although it contains little to no caffeine.<br>

		Studies suggest that the compounds in coffee have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that likely benefit your health.<br>

		Experts believe that their presence may explain why drinking coffee — whether it’s regular or decaf — is often linked to a lower risk of illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and possibly even certain types of cancer.<br><br>

		Effects on inflammation
		Current research suggests that coffee may help reduce inflammation, at least in certain individuals.<br>

		In one study, regular coffee drinkers had lower levels of inflammatory markers than non-regular coffee drinkers.<br>

		In another study, regular coffee drinkers experienced a 6% increase in their inflammatory marker levels when asked to refrain from drinking coffee for 1 month.<br>

		In comparison, they experienced an 8–16% reduction in inflammatory markers when asked to consume either 32 or 64 ounces (0.9 or 1.9 liters) of coffee per day for the same time period.<br>

		What’s more, a review of 15 studies on the effects of coffee, caffeine, and other coffee-related components on inflammatory markers found that low, medium, and high coffee intake has predominantly anti-inflammatory effects.<br>

		Nevertheless, some evidence suggests that coffee may increase inflammation in some people. Therefore, individual differences in genetics or other factors likely influence coffee’s effect on inflammation.<br>

		Inflammation can lead to a variety of effects, including frequent infections, fatigue, pain, and digestive problems. If you experience any of these while drinking coffee, consider reducing your intake to see whether doing so helps.
